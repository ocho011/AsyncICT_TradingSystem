# Project Development Summary (2025-08-29)

This document summarizes the key progress made in developing the Async ICT-based Binance Futures Trading System.

## Project Goal
To build an automated trading system based on Inner Circle Trader (ICT) concepts for Binance Futures, leveraging Python's `asyncio` for high-performance, real-time processing.

## Architectural Overview
The system is designed with an event-driven architecture, promoting modularity and scalability. Key principles include:
- **Non-blocking I/O:** All network and I/O operations are asynchronous.
- **Dependency Inversion:** Domain logic depends on abstractions (interfaces/ports), not concrete implementations.
- **Modular Structure:** Organized into `domain`, `infrastructure`, `application`, and `interfaces` layers.

## Completed Development Phases

### Phase 1: Asynchronous Basic Structure Analysis
- **Market Structure Foundation:** Implemented `AsyncMarketStructure` entity and `AsyncStructureBreakDetector` for recognizing market patterns (BOS, CHoCH).
- **Order Block Detection:** Implemented `AsyncOrderBlock` entity and `AsyncOrderBlockDetector` for identifying institutional order blocks.

### Phase 2: Asynchronous Liquidity Analysis
- **Liquidity Pool Management:** Implemented `AsyncLiquidityPool` entity and `AsyncLiquidityDetector` for identifying and monitoring liquidity zones (Equal Highs/Lows, Liquidity Sweeps).
- **Fair Value Gap (FVG) Implementation:** Implemented `AsyncFairValueGap` entity and `AsyncFVGDetector` for detecting and tracking market inefficiencies.

### Phase 3: Asynchronous Time-Based Analysis
- **Kill Zone & Macro Time Implementation:** Implemented `AsyncKillZoneManager` and `AsyncTimeBasedStrategy` for analyzing and leveraging specific high-probability trading times.

### Phase 4: Asynchronous Integration & Optimization (Scaffolded)
- **Orchestration:** The core `AsyncTradingOrchestrator` has been created to integrate and manage all developed components. It serves as the main entry point for the system.
- **Core Components:** Placeholder classes for `AsyncStrategyCoordinator`, `AsyncRiskManager`, and `AsyncOrderManager` have been created.

## Project Structure
The project follows a layered architecture within the `AsyncICT_TradingSystem/` directory.
- `domain/`: Core business logic, entities, events, and interfaces.
- `infrastructure/`: External integrations (Binance API, messaging, data storage).
- `application/`: Application-specific logic, strategies, and analysis.
- `interfaces/`: User-facing components (API, dashboard, alerts).
- `main.py`: The primary entry point for running the system.

## Dependencies
Required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt` (`pytz`, `psutil`).

## Next Steps for Continuation
To continue development, you can refer to the detailed `prompt_claude.md` for specific implementation details within each component. The system is now ready for the integration of real-time data feeds and the refinement of trading logic within the placeholder methods.
